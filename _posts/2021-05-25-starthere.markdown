## This page is under construction!

If you have received a letter through the door then congratulations, your home/business has been selected to be part of this broadband project but we need your help. <br>
Below is infomation on the project and how we're going to achieve this.

## What is this project?
The Gatehead Bank Broadband Project aims to bring ultrafast fibre optic cables straight into your home and thereby improving your connection speed and reliabilty. This project is currently in partnership with [Openreach](https://www.openreach.com/fibre-broadband/community-fibre-partnerships/) and aims to use the government's [rural gigabit broadband scheme to help fund it](https://gigabitvoucher.culture.gov.uk/). 

## What are the benefits?
* Faster download speed: approximately 30 mbps Vs up to 1000 mbps
* Property value will increase. According to Zen, Brits are willing to pay Â£1500 more for a house with full fibre broadband.[^1]
* Increased reliability - less downtime. Fibre Optic cables are less susceptible to interferance. 
* More devices are able to connect and use the network simultaneously thanks to the increased bandwith. 
* Future proof your connection - Fibre to the premises is still not fully rolled out, even in suburban areas. This will allow us to have world class broadband which is currently rare in rural areas. 

## How can I help?
